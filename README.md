# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Introduction

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The game allows the user to play against the computer. The player makes a choice between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one of these options. The game then determines the winner based on the traditional rules of the game.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute the Python script.
2. **Make a Choice**: When prompted, enter one of the following options:
   - `rock`
   - `paper`
   - `scissors`
3. **Result**: The computer will make its choice, and the result will be displayed, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied.

## Rules

- **Rock** smashes **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper**.
- **Paper** covers **Rock**.
- If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the result is a tie.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Save the script as `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

## Sample Output

```python

You choose: rock Computer choose: scissors

```
